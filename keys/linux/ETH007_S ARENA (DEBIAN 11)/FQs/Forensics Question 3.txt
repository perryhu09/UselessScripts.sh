On another system, we have identified pieces of malware that potentially could be harmful.

We have found the following assembly code sequence as part of the malware. We do not have any information about the initial state of the registers.

xor rdi, rdi
add rdi, 0x50bf536
xor rsi, rsi
add rsi, 0xa2a7674
xor rdx, rdx
add rdx, 0x2f39575
shl rdx, 3
shl rsi, 2
shl rdi, 5
xor rdx, rsi
xor rdx, rdi
mov rax, rdx
