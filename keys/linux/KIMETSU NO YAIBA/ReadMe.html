	</p><h2>Forensics Questions</h2><p> If there are "Forensics Questions" on your Desktop, you will receive points for
	answering these questions correctly.
	Valid (scored) "Forensics Questions" will only be located directly on your Desktop.
	Please read all "Forensics Questions" thoroughly before modifying this computer, as you may change something that
	prevents you from answering the question correctly.
	</p><h2>Competition Scenario</h2><p>
	This company's security policies require that all user accounts be password protected.
	Employees are required to choose secure passwords, however this policy may not be currently enforced on this
	computer.
	The presence of any non-work related media files and "hacking tools" on any computers is strictly prohibited.
	This company currently does not use any centralized maintenance or polling tools to manage their IT equipment.
	This computer is for official business use only by authorized users. This is a critical computer in a production
	environment.
	Please do <b>NOT</b> attempt to upgrade the operating system on this machine.</p><h2><b>Ubuntu 22.04</b></h2><p>
	It is company policy to use only Ubuntu 22.04 on this computer. It is also company policy to use only the
	latest, official, stable Ubuntu 22.04 packages available for required software and services on this computer.
	Management has decided that the default web browser for all users on this computer should be the latest stable
	version of Firefox. Company policy is to never let users log in as root.
		If administrators need to run commands as root, they are required to use the "sudo" command.</p><p>
	Welcome to the Demon Slayer Corps! We have located this "Konpyūtā" within the infinity castle, and we believe it has the key to defeating many demons. Please secure it with your utmost ability. We have granted you your own account, "tanjiro". Please do not edit any GECOS fields for any users, and please create the groups "hashira", "upperranks", "lowerranks", and "swordsmiths", each with their respective users.
</p>

<p>
	Also, many non-kizuki demons have infiltrated the system, and we would like you to erase all traces of them. We would also like you to configure valid SSH keys for all the hashira, and to enable public key authentication. Our VSFTPD files are located at /srv/ftp. There is information about breathing styles and demonic techniques located in the directory, so make sure that it is secured.
</p>

<p>
	In addition, even though he retired, please create a user account for tuzui with a GECOS field of "Tengen Uzui" and add him to the hashira group.
</p>

<p>
	Uncomplicated firewall (UFW) is the only authorized firewall on this computer. Please ensure it is enabled and configured. Furthermore, to enhance security, please set the SSH port to 2934. You may keep the Very Secure FTPD port and the PostgreSQL port as their defaults. The only users that should have access to PostgreSQL are tanjiro and the default PostgreSQL user.
</p>


<p>
	Lastly, our systems require a plethora of other services, which are LibreOffice, GIMP, Auditd, and ClamAV. Please ensure that these are up-to-date and secured. The only SSL files allowed for the critical services are located at /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem and /etc/ssl/private/ssl-certs-snakeoil.key
</p>

<p><b>Critical Services:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>OpenSSH Server</li>
