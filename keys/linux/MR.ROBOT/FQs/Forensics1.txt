SSH keys are sensitive information and should be protected. They're usually 
found in a users home directory under a subdirectory called .ssh. These should 
be protected by file permissions restricting access only to the user.

authorized to log in as a user. This file should also be protected so that an 
attacker can't add their own public key. What is the uid of the owner of fred's
