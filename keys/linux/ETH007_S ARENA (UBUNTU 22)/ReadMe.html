<h1><b>Ubuntu 22 Mock Semifinals 2024 README</b></h1><p> Please read the entire README thoroughly before modifying anything on this computer.</p>
	<h2>Unique Identifier</h2>
	<p> If you have not yet entered a valid Team ID, please do so immediately by double clicking on the "Team ID" icon
	on the desktop.
	If you do not enter a valid Team ID this VM may stop functioning after a short period of time.
	</p><h2>Forensics Questions</h2><p> If there are "Forensics Questions" on your Desktop, you will receive points for
	answering these questions correctly.
	Valid (scored) "Forensics Questions" will only be located directly on your Desktop.
	Please read all "Forensics Questions" thoroughly before modifying this computer, as you may change something that
	prevents you from answering the question correctly.
	</p><h2>Competition Scenario</h2><p>
	This company's security policies require that all user accounts be password protected.
	Employees are required to choose secure passwords, however this policy may not be currently enforced on this
	computer.
	The presence of any non-work related media files and "hacking tools" on any computers is strictly prohibited.
	This company currently does not use any centralized maintenance or polling tools to manage their IT equipment.
	This computer is for official business use only by authorized users. This is a critical computer in a production
	environment.
	Please do <b>NOT</b> attempt to upgrade the operating system on this machine.</p><h2><b>Ubuntu 22</b></h2><p>
	It is company policy to use only Ubuntu 22 on this computer. It is also company policy to use only the
	latest, official, stable Ubuntu 22 packages available for required software and services on this computer.
	Management has decided that the default web browser for all users on this computer should be the latest stable
	version of Firefox, Thunderbird, and ssh-agent. Firefox should be installed through a Personal Package Archive (PPA), and not as a snap. Company policy is to never let users log in as root.
		If administrators need to run commands as root, they are required to use the "sudo" command.</p>
<p>
	Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) is the only approved Firewall for use
	on Linux machines at this time. 
</p>
<p>
	This server is authorized to run an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack, which is used for log aggregation and analysis to detect any security anomalies on our network. The Kibana frontend is currently exposed to the web through an NGINX proxy. You can access this through the URL <a href="http://kibana.inside.out/">http://kibana.inside.out/</a>, with username "elastic" and password "IjE37K8a69NKIf190h0n". Do not configure NGINX at this time; leave it set up as-is. 
</p>
<p>
	SSH public key authentication should be enabled, although password authentication should still be permitted. The user "anger" wishes to log in through SSH. Please configure a SSH key for him, and make sure he can log in with it. 
</p>

<p><b>Critical Services:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>SSH (openssh-server)</li>
	<li>Samba server (smbd)</li>
	<li>Elasticsearch (elasticsearch)</li>
