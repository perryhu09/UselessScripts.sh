Recount the story of TCD's security breach as well as you can. Use your previous answers from forensics as well as what you have found on the system. This question will not be scored by the scoring engine. Instead, write your answer on the piece of paper provided so it can be hand graded.

P.S. The story was actually pretty simple. More details are great and will get you more points but you do not have to write a novel.
