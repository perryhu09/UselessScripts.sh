Decipher the text below. You need three numbers to solve this problem. One of those numbers will be in a plaintext file hidden somewhere on the system. The other two will be found by following the hints below. 

Hint: There are 5 “hacking” tools on this computer. Once you have found the 5, sort them in alphabetical order. Look at the first letter of each of them and think about that letter’s numerical place in the alphabet (for instance, A is 1, B is 2, etc). Let the sum of these numerical values be denoted as X.
Hint 2: X + 2
Hint 3: X - 4 
Hint 4: Rotten Sausage Awesomeness
