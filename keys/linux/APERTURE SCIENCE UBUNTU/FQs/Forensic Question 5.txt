Greetings Ratman,

Companion Cube recently added Aperture Science's nuclear launch codes to a shared repository, but since it has commitment issues (don't we all?), it accidentally used Wheatley's former GitHub credentials to commit the launch codes to a different repository altogether. And to make matters worse, Wheatley's GitHub credentials and the repository were automatically deleted upon his removal from Aperture.

But Wheatley having the nuclear launch codes is not the issue at hand: in fact, GLaDOS disabled all five hundred million of them in case he uses them to attack the facility while in space. The problem is that top-secret intel about the Aperture Handheld Portal Device is scattered within the list of nuclear launch codes that Wheatley can use to create his own Portal Gun, should he ever return to Earth. We need you to find the launch codes and reconstruct all of our Portal Gun intel. Once you do that, we'll take care of the rest and use our connections to remove the repository.

P.S. Aperture forensic analysts were able to uncover some information stored in Companion Cube's memory of the incident. It seems like gibberish to me, but perhaps you can make some sense out of it?
